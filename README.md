# Melanoma Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains code for a melanoma detection project using deep learning techniques. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The project aims to develop a reliable system for identifying melanoma from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced image processing techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`:** Directory containing the melanoma dataset.
- **`models/`:** Directory containing trained deep learning models.
- **`results/`:** Directory for storing evaluation results and metrics.
- **`src/`:** Source code directory containing Python scripts for model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- seaborn

##  Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the melanoma dataset is stored in the data/ directory.
Model Training: Train the deep learning models by running the appropriate scripts in the src/ directory.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using the test dataset and analyze the results.
Prediction: Use the trained models to predict melanoma from new images.
